# Scaling Deep Learning

A learning repo on scaling deep learning

## A First Notebook

Simple basic pytorch lightning:
- Edits need to Trainer
- gpus set correctly
- add accelerator

Limitations:
- can't use the "nicer" accelerators.
- Seems like ddp is the only one with no caveats and that requires script?
